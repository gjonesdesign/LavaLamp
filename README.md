# LavaLamp
This program uses blob detections to read shapes from a lavalamp (or any other objects) to create sounds using sin waves. This is done by taking in the coordinates of the x and y of a blob centriod, and mapping it to the frequency and tune of the tone.

## INSTRUCTIONS  
Due to technical limitations, this program does not take in live camera footage, but instead pulls video feed from a video file. In order to run the program, simply place the video into the data file and run the program. The video file must either be named "lava.mov", or you must change the funcitons in the program to load the name of your video file.
